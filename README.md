- 👋 Hi, I’m @gregcousins
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics, statistics, logic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, data science.
- 💞️ I'm currently an assistant professor of math and stats, but I'm looking to transition to an industry position in something techy. I'm particularly
-    interested in positions where I would have the opportunity to work with a team of people with similar interests, and working on interesting problems.
